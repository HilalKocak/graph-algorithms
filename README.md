### Graph Algorithms
##### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- dfs-recursive.js: Implements DFS using recursion.
- dfs.js: Implements DFS without recursion, using a stack.
##### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- bfs.js: Implements BFS using a queue.
##### Path Existence in Graphs
- hasPath.js: Determines if there is a path between two nodes in a directed graph.
- hasPathUndir.js: Determines if there is a path between two nodes in an undirected graph.
##### Shortest Path
- shortest-path.js: Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
##### Island Problems
- island-count.js: Counts the number of islands in a grid.
- largest-component.js: Finds the size of the largest island in a grid.
- min-island.js: Finds the size of the smallest island in a grid.
