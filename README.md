### Graph Algorithms
* Directed graphs
* Traverse a graph using
- Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search
* hasPath Problem: Is there a way to determine if there's a path from one node to another with depth-first stack and breadth-first queue Ä±n directed graphs and undirected graphs

* Connected components count problem
